KeepAliveApplication
Simple example of console app to keep alive one application (.exe)

If you need to survey application maybe you can schedule this application every x seconds/minutes/ecc.

I would not use infinite loops in the code to avoid application crashes

any suggestions or changes are welcome ;)
